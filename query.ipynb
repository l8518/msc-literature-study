Programs executed in one context are astonishingly hard to reproduce in another context, resulting in wasted effort by people and general distrust of results produced by computer. The root of the problem lies in the fact that every program has implicit dependencies on data and execution environment which are rarely understood by the end user. To address this problem, we present PRUNE, the Preserving Run Environment. In PRUNE, every task to be executed is wrapped in a functional interface and coupled with a strictly defined environment. The task is then executed by PRUNE rather than the user to ensure reproducibility. As a scientific workflow evolves in PRUNE, a growing but immutable tree of derived data is created. The provenance of every item in the system can be precisely described, facilitating sharing and modification between collaborating researchers, along with efficient management of limited storage space. We present the user interface and the initial prototype of PRUNE, and demonstrate its application in matching records and comparing surnames in U.S. Censuses.', 2016, 'e-Science', '10.1109/eScience.2016.7870886', 1, None)\n",

When there is large quantity of data, the efficiency of traditional algorithms of Kth shortest paths is relatively low, and some path problems concerning big difference between the planned Kth paths under actual requirements cannot be solved. On the basis of Dijkstra algorithm, the concepts of favorability and repeatability are introduced to find Kth paths including the shortest in the current graph cyclically by determination of repeatability of path results and the change of graph caused by the change of favorability, thereby realizing the planning of multiple different paths. Compared with similar algorithms, this algorithm is faster, and the multiple path results obtained meet the requirement for certain repeatability while the lengths of paths are also quite reasonable.', 2014, 'ISCID', '10.1109/ISCID.2014.148', 0, None)\n",

The reproducibility of scientific workflows is therefore fundamental to reproducible e-Science. However, the ability to record all the required details so as to make a workflow fully reproducible is a long-standing problem that is very difficult to solve. In this paper, we introduce an approach that integrates system description, source control, container management and automatic deployment techniques to facilitate workflow reproducibility. We have developed a framework that leverages this integration to support workflow execution, re-execution and reproducibility in the cloud and in a personal computing environment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by examining various aspects of repeatability and reproducibility on real scientific workflows. The framework allows workflow and task images to be captured automatically, which improves not only repeatability but also runtime performance. It also gives workflows portability across different cloud environments. Finally, the framework can also track changes in the development of tasks and workflows to protect them from unintentional failures.', 2016, 'e-Science', '10.1109/eScience.2016.7870888', 16, None)\n",

While scripting languages, such as Python, R and Perl, are the means of choice of the majority of scientists to encode and run their data analysis, scripts are generally not amenable to reuse or reproducibility. Scripts do rarely get reused or even shared with third party scientists. We argue in this paper that the reproducibility of scripts can be promoted by converting them into workflow research objects. A workflow research object encodes a script into a production (executable) workflow that is accompanied by annotations, example datasets and provenance traces of their execution, thereby allowing third party users to understand the data analysis encoded by the original script, run the associated workflow using the same or different dataset, or even repurpose it for a different analysis. To this end, we present a methodology for converting scripts into workflow research objects in a principled manner, guided by requirements that we elicited for this purpose. The methodology exploits tools and standards that have been developed by the community, in particular YesWorkflow, Research Objects and the W3C PROV.

The model uses a chunk partition strategy, in which all simulation elements are wrapped into chunks and simulated sequentially inside each chunk. We can simulate multiple chunks in parallel as often as possible by adding seed and a pseudo-random number generator in each of them, thus ensuring the same results. This model was integrated into the JSensor simulator and validated accordingly. An important aspect is that the new reproducibility model does not alter the simulationâ\\x80\\x99s semantics, and it is transparent to the developer.

However, the combination of dynamic scheduling of parallel computing resources, and floating point nonassociativity, makes attaining reproducibility a challenge even for simple reduction operations like computing the sum of a vector of numbers in parallel. We propose a technique for floating point summation that is reproducible independent of the order of summation. Our technique uses Rump's algorithm for error-free vector transformation [7], and is much more efficient than using (possibly very) high precision arithmetic. Our algorithm reproducibly computes highly accurate results with an absolute error bound of n Â· 2-28 macheps maxiIviI at a cost of 7n FLOPs and a small constant amount of extra memory usage. Higher accuracies are also possible by increasing the number of error-free transformations. As long as all operations are performed in to-nearest rounding mode, results computed by the proposed algorithms are reproducible for any run on any platform. In particular, our algorithm requires the minimum number of reductions, i.e. one reduction of an array of six double precision floating point numbers per sum, and hence is well suited for massively parallel environments.\", 2015, 'TC', '10.1109/TC.2014.2345391', 34, None)\n",

ETA illuminates the sample with light of fixed polarization and uses a rotating analyzer to measure the polarization of the reflected light. Sample alignment is done automatically by ETA, so that usually no operator adjustments are required. Fourier analysis of the light transmitted by the analyzer is used to reduce noise and enhance measurement precision. In its normal mode of operation (incident light linearly polarized at 45°), ETA can measure single and double-layer films of SiO2, and Si3N4, in the thickness range of 300 to 800 Å with precision comparable to that of conventional ellipsometers. Other modes of operation, which make use of a fixed-position compensator in the incident light path, allow precise measurement of thin films (0 to 300Å) and permit use of ETA as a general-purpose ellipsometer.
