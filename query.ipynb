Unlike existing interest point detectors, which measure pixel-wise differences in image intensity, our detectors incorporate histogram-based representations, and thus can find image regions that present a distinct distribution in the neighborhood. The proposed detectors are able to capture large-scale structures and distinctive textured patterns, and exhibit strong invariance to rotation, illumination variation, and blur. The experimental results show that the proposed histogram-based interest point detectors perform particularly well for the tasks of matching textured scenes under blur and illumination changes, in terms of repeatability and distinctiveness. An extension of our method to space-time interest point detection for action classification is also presented.', 2009, 'CVPR', '10.1109/CVPR.2009.5206521', 29)\n",

The main focus of the paper is on execution of scientific algorithms (such as algorithms from the music information retrieval domain) by enabling the sharing of algorithm implementations, the reproducibility of results, and an easy access to non-experts of distributed environments. We propose a method of automatic deployment of client command line applications in PaaS and IaaS clouds which, unlike to existing approaches, requires neither preliminary platform configuration, nor platform configuration description. We designed a deployment manager using an expert system in order to automatically setup a virtual execution platform, by resolving dependencies and solving configuration issues on the basis of a pre-existing knowledge base.', 2014, 'HPCC', '10.1109/HPCC.2014.88', 0)\n",

One way to prepare the Exascale challenge is to manage uncertainties. Several approximations occur during a numerical simulation from the physical world to the floating point computation. Among these uncertainties, the floating-point arithmetic approximation will be more and more taken into account to perform a rigorous Verification & Validation process. It will also help to explain possible non numerical reproducibility, to optimize the amount of memory for a specified precision on the results and to improve the software development chain.

This problem is encountered in data parallel execution environments such as GPUs, where reproducibility involving floating-point atomic addition is challenging. This problem is due to the rounding error or cancellation that appears for each operation, combined with the lack of control over execution order. In this article we propose two solutions to address this problem: work reassignment and fixed-point accumulation. Work reassignment consists in enforcing an execution order that leads to weak reproducibility. Fixed-point accumulation consists in avoiding rounding errors altogether thanks to a long accumulator and enables strong reproducibility.', 2015, 'FedCSIS', '10.15439/2015F86', 3)\n",
